# Construction of a simplified RNA-based Knowledge Graph

This repository contains notebooks, data, and ontologies to build a simplified RNA-centered Knowledge Graph (that involves **gene-disease**, **gene-miRNA**, and **miRNA-disease** relationships) exploiting [PheKnowLator](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator) functionalities.
