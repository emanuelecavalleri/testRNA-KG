<p style="text-align: center;">Construction of a simplified RNA-based Knowledge Graph</p>

[PheKnowLator](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator) is a system that support the user in the acquisition of biomedical entities from different kinds of data sources and their representation in terms of a biomedical knowledge graph that models unbiased molecular mechanisms as prescribed by domain ontologies. In this repository we wish to show the use of PheKnowLator for the generation of a RNA-based knowledge graph that involves **gene-disease**, **gene-miRNA**, and **miRNA-disease** relationships.
