# Construction of a simplified RNA-based Knowledge Graph

In this repository we wish to show the use of [PheKnowLator](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator) for the generation of a RNA-based knowledge graph that involves **gene-disease**, **gene-miRNA**, and **miRNA-disease** relationships.
